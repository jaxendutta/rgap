    "## 4. Findings and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal Patterns**: \n",
    "   - Clear seasonal peaks in grant distributions, with major spikes in April and May (~5,500-6,000 grants each)\n",
    "   - NSERC shows the highest activity in these peak months, followed by SSHRC\n",
    "   - Secondary peak in September (~3,000 grants)\n",
    "   - Relatively quiet periods in summer (July-August) and winter (December-January)\n",
    "   - Most agencies align their major grant distributions in spring months\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Funding Distribution**:\n",
    "   - Total grant volume: 20,817 unique grants across all agencies\n",
    "   - Agency breakdown:\n",
    "     * NSERC: 12,080 grants (58% of volume but only 34% of total funding)\n",
    "     * SSHRC: 5,454 grants (26% of volume, 34% of funding)\n",
    "     * CIHR: 3,283 grants (16% of volume, 32% of funding)\n",
    "   - Average grant values vary significantly:\n",
    "     * CIHR: Highest average at $319,331 per grant\n",
    "     * SSHRC: Middle range at $200,184 per grant\n",
    "     * NSERC: Lowest average at $91,679 per grant\n",
    "   - Box plot shows CIHR has the highest median funding values and largest spread\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Geographic Concentration**:\n",
    "   - Strong regional disparities in funding distribution\n",
    "   - Ontario dominates with $1.3B total funding (32% of all funding)\n",
    "   - Quebec follows with $845M (21% of total funding)\n",
    "   - British Columbia third with $424M (10% of total funding)\n",
    "   - These three provinces account for 63% of all research funding\n",
    "   - Territories and smaller provinces receive significantly less funding\n",
    "   - Some international funding present, primarily in US states (though minimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Institutional Leadership**:\n",
    "   - Top recipients show strong institutional concentration\n",
    "   - University of Toronto leads with single largest grant ($46.5M)\n",
    "   - Major research universities dominate the top 10\n",
    "   - Individual researchers appear in top recipients (e.g., Chertkow, Howard M with $31.6M CIHR grant)\n",
    "   - Montreal/Quebec institutions feature prominently (McGill, UdeM, Laval)\n",
    "   - All top 10 recipients received grants over $13.9M\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights reveal a research funding landscape characterized by strong geographic and institutional concentration, significant variations in grant sizes between agencies, and clear temporal patterns in grant distributions."
